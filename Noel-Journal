Today I showed up to Ali's class late due to a class clash and joined a group, we are working on github branching
and pushing changes to a remote repository that is owned by the git master which is Aaron, we had a little trouble
finding out how to add the rest of us as collaborators but didnt realise the email would help us verify out place 
as a collaborator, and now that we have had a successful push to the remote repository we are all on the way to 
completing this lab.
