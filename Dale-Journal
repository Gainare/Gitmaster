Hello Team,

Thank you for the join.

Ali,

After arriving to class from my 'conflict class' I joined a team attempting to add collaborators to the master file, however 
the team were struggling to add collaborators which meant they were unable to create a new branch or merge that branch back 
to the master.

I thought if I could clone the repository this would solve the issue, I had mixed results. The clone worked, I created the new branch
and the master account holder was recording my commits etc. but my branch was not visible and I was unable to merge to the 
master.

I suspected this might be a result of doing the branch when not being an approved collaborator. The collaborator issue was 
resolved and I duplicated the process but alas this proved fruitless. In order to confirm my suspicion that the issue related 
to the collaborator problem I asked the team associated with 'Gainare' if I could kindly be added to their Gitmaster so I 
could attempt the process again.

This appeared to do the trick and all appears well. 

Kind Regards

Dale
